# Decentralized Pandemic Early Warning System

A blockchain-based platform for early detection and response to potential disease outbreaks through distributed data collection, AI analysis, and coordinated resource deployment.

## Overview

The Decentralized Pandemic Early Warning System enables real-time monitoring of public health data to identify and respond to potential disease outbreaks. The platform combines data from multiple sources, leverages AI for pattern detection, and coordinates rapid response efforts while ensuring data privacy and security.

## Core Components

### Data Collection Contract
- Aggregates health data from multiple sources
- Manages data validation and verification
- Implements privacy-preserving protocols
- Handles data standardization
- Maintains data quality controls
- Coordinates with healthcare providers
- Manages anonymization processes

### AI Analysis Contract
- Processes health data in real-time
- Identifies potential outbreak patterns
- Implements predictive modeling
- Analyzes transmission patterns
- Tracks mutation variations
- Assesses risk levels
- Generates outbreak projections

### Alert System Contract
- Issues graduated warning levels
- Manages notification distribution
- Coordinates with health authorities
- Tracks alert acknowledgments
- Manages communication protocols
- Handles alert verification
- Implements response tracking

### Resource Allocation Contract
- Manages medical supply distribution
- Coordinates healthcare resources
- Tracks inventory levels
- Optimizes resource deployment
- Manages supply chain logistics
- Handles emergency requisitions
- Coordinates with suppliers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- Healthcare data integration capability
- AI/ML processing environment
- Secure communication infrastructure
- Resource management system

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pandemic-warning.git

# Install dependencies
cd pandemic-warning
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Set environment variables in `.env`:
    - `HEALTH_DATA_KEY`: Healthcare system access
    - `AI_SERVICE_KEY`: Analysis system access
    - `ALERT_API_KEY`: Emergency notification system
    - `RESOURCE_API_KEY`: Supply chain management

2. Configure system parameters in `config.js`:
    - Data collection parameters
    - Analysis thresholds
    - Alert criteria
    - Resource allocation rules

## Usage

### Data Collection
```javascript
// Example of submitting health data
await dataCollection.submitData(
    sourceId,
    healthMetrics,
    location,
    timestamp
);
```

### Pattern Analysis
```javascript
// Example of analyzing outbreak patterns
await aiAnalysis.analyzePatterns(
    dataSet,
    region,
    timeframe,
    parameters
);
```

### Alert Management
```javascript
// Example of issuing health alert
await alertSystem.issueWarning(
    severity,
    affectedRegions,
    recommendations,
    timeline
);
```

### Resource Management
```javascript
// Example of allocating resources
await resourceAllocation.deployResources(
    location,
    resourceType,
    quantity,
    priority
);
```
